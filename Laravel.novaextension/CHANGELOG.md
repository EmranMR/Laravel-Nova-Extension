## v1.6.0

  [conflict internally in Nova, when using injected languages](https://devforum.nova.app/t/comment-shortcut-improvement-in-complex-comment-situations-in-tree-sitter-based-syntax-extension/2220)
- There are three ways you can comments in blade files.

##### 1. Typing `{`

## v.1.1.1

### Bug Fixes: 🐞

- Fixes attribute html injection problems. See #11

## v1.1.0

### New Features ✨:

#### 1. Completion now covers all the directives supported in

`tree-sitter-blade` and they are as it follows:

- **loops**
  - `@for`
  - `@foreach`
  - `@forelse`
  - `@while`
- **Livewire 🪼**
  - `@persist`
  - `@teleport`
  - `@volt`

#### 2. Syntax Highlighting adjustment

- The attribute directives now match the theme colouring for
  `tag.attribute.name`
- For other directives theme selector has been changed to
  `tag.framework` so that it is semantically correct

### Bug Fixes: 🐞

- Fixed the issue `@verbatim` adding parameter in completion
- Remove duplicate `@break` until the issue is fixed in #10

## 📣 1.0.0 🎉

##### Finally support for `php` **injection** 🥳 as well php autocompletion that is provided by Nova! see below for more info 👇

- This includes
  - inside `parameters`, `{{ }}` `@php @endphp` or anywhere else you
    expect syntax highlighting!
- The `php` injection would have **NOT** been possible without the
  work done @CalebDW on the core `tree-sitter-php`🙏 see
  [tree-sitter-php split_parser pull request draft](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-php/pull/180)
  - To get this work, I cloned the `split_parser draft`, then
    `php-only` subsyntax was created in Nova
  - Then all the first party `completions`, `queries` were copied, and
    adjusted to support the new `php-only` **sub-syntax**
  - This is a temporary measure until the pull request is merged, and
    then adopted by Nova, which might take a long time.

##### Other Updates

- Updated the submodules to the latest version
- Completion file names all adjusted to avoid confusion, prefixed with
  `php` or `blade`
- Added adjusted `makeFile` to `tree-sitter-php-only` to allow
  generation of correct dynamic library for Nova
