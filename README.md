### 🚧 Experimental, Pre-Release 🚧
Hello 👋

This is a `tree-sitter` based Laravel blade extension.
-   The extension is not quite there yet, because of the shortcomings
    with `tree-sitter-php`. However feel free to use it for
    experimenting and testing. I would appreciate any feedbacks.

    So do not forget to [**raise an issue**](https://github.com/EmranMR/Laravel-Nova-Extension/issues) for *problems* and *feature* requests! 😏
-   Hoping for this extension to be an **_all in one_** for Laravel
    projects. A bit ambitious but hopefully we can get there one day!
-   The
    [tree-sitter-blade](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade)
    itself is also new and I am still working on it. It is
    however fairly stable.

### Working Features

-   The `tree-sitter-blade` is up to date as of 10.x
-   Livewire directives support including the upcoming v3.0
-   [tree-sitter](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade) based
    syntax highlighting and autocompletion support
-   Context aware autocompletion (*wip*)
-   Support for indentation increase/decrease
-   Folding Support

### Features Not Working

-   [ ] php injection support
    -   see
        [tree-sitter-blade issue #5](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade/issues/5)
    -   Also see
        [tree-sitter-php](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-php/pull/180)
-   [ ] Completion for views?

### Staying up-to-date?

I would suggest starring/watching
[the extensions repository](https://github.com/EmranMR/Laravel-Nova-Extension)
for staying up to date with the release notes.

Also feel free to have a look at the
[tree-sitter-blade](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade) and
contribute via issues or discussions. They go hand in hand.

### Issues:
##### tree-sitter-blade
If you see any problem with *parsing*, it is very related to `tree-sitter-blade`. So please [raise an issue on that repo](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade/issues)
##### Laravel Suit
Anything else please raise an issue on [Laravel Suit repo](https://github.com/EmranMR/Laravel-Nova-Extension/issues)
##### What if I dont know?
Well raise it in either repos and I will link it up to the correct repo, I won't bite, I promise! 🔪 👀 After all it is hard to draw the line sometimes for example in terms of highlighting or folding.
