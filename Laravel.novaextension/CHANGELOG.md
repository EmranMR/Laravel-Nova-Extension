## v.1.1.1

### Bug Fixes: üêû

-   Fixes attribute html injection problems. See #11

## v1.1.0

### New Features ‚ú®:

#### 1. Completion now covers all the directives supported in

`tree-sitter-blade` and they are as it follows:

-   **loops**
    -   `@for`
    -   `@foreach`
    -   `@forelse`
    -   `@while`
-   **Livewire ü™º**
    -   `@persist`
    -   `@teleport`
    -   `@volt`

#### 2. Syntax Highlighting adjustment

-   The attribute directives now match the theme colouring for
    `tag.attribute.name`
-   For other directives theme selector has been changed to
    `tag.framework` so that it is semantically correct

### Bug Fixes: üêû

-   Fixed the issue `@verbatim` adding parameter in completion
-   Remove duplicate `@break` until the issue is fixed in #10

## üì£ 1.0.0 üéâ

##### Finally support for `php` **injection** ü•≥ as well php autocompletion that is provided by Nova! see below for more info üëá

-   This includes
    -   inside `parameters`, `{{ }}` `@php @endphp` or anywhere else
        you expect syntax highlighting!
-   The `php` injection would have **NOT** been possible without the
    work done @CalebDW on the core `tree-sitter-php`üôè see
    [tree-sitter-php split_parser pull request draft](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-php/pull/180)
    -   To get this work, I cloned the `split_parser draft`, then
        `php-only` subsyntax was created in Nova
    -   Then all the first party `completions`, `queries` were copied,
        and adjusted to support the new `php-only` **sub-syntax**
    -   This is a temporary measure until the pull request is merged,
        and then adopted by Nova, which might take a long time.

##### Other Updates

-   Updated the submodules to the latest version
-   Completion file names all adjusted to avoid confusion, prefixed
    with `php` or `blade`
-   Added adjusted `makeFile` to `tree-sitter-php-only` to allow
    generation of correct dynamic library for Nova
