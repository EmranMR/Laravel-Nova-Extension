### ðŸš§ Experimental, Pre-Release ðŸš§

-   This extension is not quite there yet, because of the shortcomings
    with `tree-sitter-php`. However feel free to use it for
    experimenting and testing until the issues are fixed.
-   The
    [tree-sitter-blade](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade)
    itself is also fairly new and I am still working on it. It is
    however fairly stable.

### Working Features

-   The `tree-sitter-blade` is up to date as of 10.x
-   Hoping for this extension to be an **_all in one_** for Laravel
    projects. A bit ambitious but hopefully we can get there one day
-   [tree-sitter](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade) based
    syntax highlighting and autocompletion support
-   Context aware autocompletion
-   Support for indentation increase/decrease

### Features Not Working

-   [ ] php injection support
-   [ ] Support for folding (TBA)
-   [ ] Completion for views?
    -   see
        [tree-sitter-blade issue #5](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade/issues/5)
    -   Also see
        [tree-sitter-php](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-php/pull/180)

### Staying up-to-date?

I would suggest starring/watching
[the extensions repository](https://github.com/EmranMR/Laravel-Nova-Extension)
for staying up to date with the release notes.

Also feel free to have a look at the
[tree-sitter-blade](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade) and
contribute via issues or discussions. They go hand in hand.
